        Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[21][22] Mars has a second smallest radius among the planets in the Solar System at 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi) and has a surface gravity of 3.72 m/s2 (12.2 ft/s2), which is 38% of Earth's gravity. Terrain on the Martian northern hemisphere is on average flatter and smoother than the southern hemisphere, giving rise to the Martian dichotomy. Mars has a very thin atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide and two irregularly shaped natural satellites: Phobos and Deimos.

Geologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping across the landscape and marsquakes (Martian analog to earthquakes) trembling underneath the ground. The surface of Mars hosts the highest mountain (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). <br>The internal structure of Mars is thought to be composed of an outer crust, a mantle made of silicates, and an inner liquid core. Mars's celestial motion is comparable to that of Earth, with a slightly eccentric orbit and an axial tilt only slightly greater than Earth's. This motion cause seasonal changes to the polar ice caps' coverage and temperature swing between −110 °C (−166 °F) to 35 °C (95 °F) on the surface. A Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years.

Like the other planets in the Solar System, Mars was formed 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period from about 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to 3.2–2 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues today, was marked by the wind's influence on geological processes. It is not yet known whether life has ever existed on Mars, though search for evidences of life on Mars is still ongoing.

Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and thus has been known from the ancient times. The Romans named it for the god of war, Mārs, as did Greeks (Ares) and Mesopotamians (Nergal), likely because its color suggested blood. Its high-contrast albedo features make it an attractive target for viewing with a telescope.<br>

Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the first flyby by the Mariner 4 probe in 1965, the first Mars orbiter by the Mars 2 probe in 1971, and the first landing by the Viking 1 in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11 active probes orbiting Mars or at the Martian surface. Currently, Mars is an attractive target for the first future interplanetary human missions.
